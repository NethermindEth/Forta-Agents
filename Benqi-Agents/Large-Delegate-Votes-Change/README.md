# Delegate Votes Monitor Agent

## Description

This agent detects large increments in a delegate account's QI token vote
balance by monitoring `DelegateVotesChanged` events emitted by the token
contract.

The threshold that determines whether a change is classified as large is
adjustable in the `constants.ts` file.

## Supported Chains

- Avalanche

## Alerts

  - Fired when a delegate account's vote balance increase, based on the

  - Type is always set to "Info"
  - Metadata contains:
    - `delegate`: Address of the related delegate
    - `previousBalance`: Previous delegate vote balance
