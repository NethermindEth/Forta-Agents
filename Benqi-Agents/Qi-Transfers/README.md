# QI Token Large Transfer and Large Balance Agent

## Description

This agent detects transfers of a large amount of `QI` tokens and accounts with large amount of `QI` balance.

- Threshold for transferred token amount can be set at `src/utils.ts` line 17. The default amount is set to 1 million tokens.

```
const THRESHOLD_TRANSFER_AMOUNT: number = 1000000;
```

- Threshold percentage of `QI` token total supply for balances can be set `src/utils.ts` line 16. The default value is set to 5 percent.

```
const THRESHOLD_BALANCE_PERCENTAGE: number = 5;
```

## Test Data

### Mainnet

The agent behaviour can be verified with the following test transactions in `AVAX Mainnet Network` if `TRANSFERED_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` is lowered to 6000.

### Testnet

A PoC `QI Token Contract` is deployed on `AVAX Testnet Network` to catch the monitored conditions.
In order to run this agent on `AVAX Testnet Network`, two steps must be done:

1. `isTestnet` variable must be changed to `true` at `src/utils.ts` line 8:

```
const isTestnet: boolean = true;
```

Default value is false, which means the agent will run for `QI Token Contract` deployed in `AVAX Mainnet` if it's not changed to `true`.

2. `jsonRpcUrl` in `forta.config.json` must be `https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`
