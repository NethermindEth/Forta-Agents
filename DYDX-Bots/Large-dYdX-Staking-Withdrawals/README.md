# Large DYDX Deposit/Withdrawal Bot

## Description

This bot detects DYDX deposits and withdrawals in the Safety Module contract when the `underlyingAmount` is high.

> The bot can operate in two different modes, used to determine the threshold of a _large_ deposit/withdrawal amount.
>
> - `STATIC` mode refers to the bot using a static predefined threshold.
> - `PERCENTAGE` refers to setting the threshold as a percentage of the total staked tokens.

> In order to switch between the two modes, change `DYNAMIC_CONFIG` to `STATIC_CONFG` in agent.ts, L54.

You can ajust `thresholdData` in `config.ts` for each mode in order to generate a finding.

  - `underlyingAmount`: 700,000 (20% of total staked).
  - `PERCENTAGE` mode generates a finding with `thresholdData` set to 20 or less.
  - `STATIC` mode generates a finding with `thresholdData` set to 700,000 or less.
