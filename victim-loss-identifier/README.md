# ü§ñ Victim & Loss Identifier Bot

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description

This bot is designed to identify victims of end-user attacks and calculate their losses. Its functionality revolves around monitoring alerts from the [Scam Detector Feed](https://app.forta.network/bot/0x1d646c4045189991fdfd24a66b192a294158b839a6ec121d740474bdacb3ab23) bot. When it receives an alert, the bot extracts information related to the scammer's addresses and threat category. Subsequently, it provides answers to questions about who the victims of the scammer are and what digital assets have been transferred from these victims to the scammer.

To accomplish this, the bot accesses historical data related to the scammer, going back 90 days (a configurable value). It then quantifies each digital asset by converting its value into USD.

The bot continues its assessment of victims and losses on a daily basis, with the time interval being configurable, starting from the moment it first received an alert from the Scam Detector Feed. This assessment continues for 30 days after the last known activity of the scammer.

## üß™ Test Data

To verify the bot's behavior, you'll need to meet the following prerequisites.

1. [Generate a Forta API Key](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/api-reference/#generating-api-keys) and then create a `forta.config.json` in the root directory of the bot like this:

```json
{
  "fortaApiKey": "Your-Forta-API-Key"
}
```

2. Accuire a Zettablock API key and an Alchemy API key and then create a `secrets.json` in the root directory of the bot like this:

```json
{
  "generalApiKeys": {
    "ZETTABLOCK": ["Your-Zettablock-API-Key"]
  },
  "apiKeys": {
    "victimLoss": {
      "alchemyApiKey": "Your-Alchemy-API-Key"
    }
  }
}
```

You can verify the bot's behavior by following these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Run the bot for a specific underyling bot's alert, like this:

```
npm run alert 0x98513fc3790aed850af40293cedb2cd567a25234c4c31e9ba4d31947c77e070e
```

The example alert is for the following transaction:

- [0xb5c5c79e33831f5686572d2c4877542da22c0f9f5be529267c60cba77bb72ba8](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb5c5c79e33831f5686572d2c4877542da22c0f9f5be529267c60cba77bb72ba8) (VICTIM-LOSS-INFORMATION)
