## Detect anomalous Transaction Value

### Overview

This agent detects transactions with unusual amount of gas used. It checks every transaction one by one and evalutes each of them by `MEDIUM_GAS_THRESHOLD` and `HIGH_GAS_THRESHOLD`.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Run

Before run the agent to see how it works with real data, specify the `JSON-RPC` provider in the forta.config.json file. Uncomment the `jsonRpcUrl` property and set it to a websocket provider (e.g. `wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/`) if deploying in production, else use HTTP provider if testing with jest. Then ready to run the agent.

```
npm start
```

## Test

```
npm test
```
